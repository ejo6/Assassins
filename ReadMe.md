# Assassins
This small java project represents a lightweight manager for the popular water gun game "Assassins" often played in high schools and other social groups. I wanted to remake an older version with impoved efficiey and data structures, representing the core list as a custom doubly linked list which become a cyclical graph by linking the head and tail nodes. This improves on random target assignment because it prevents any smaller internal loops resulting in two players targeting each other. This is a WIP and I intend on adding better features and UI.

Please feel free to fork or add any ideas you want to see implemented.
